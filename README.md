# Digital Clinical Safety Platform (DCSP)
A web based app for building out markdown files for the documentation of clinical safety hazard logs DCB0129 and DCB0160.

Other documentation templates can be uploaded

# The build
- Python based backend
- Some javascript in the front end
- Django for the dynamic site. This is used to build up and edit the static site
- Materials for MkDocs for the static site (where the clinical safety documentation is stored.)
